# PHP OO Class - 14 and 15
Files created during the last classes of PHP Object-Oriented Class - Curso em VÃ­deo (CeV).

- Creation of a final project using what was learned;
- New concept during the development: Inheriting code from the constructor's superclass;

During these classes, we answered questions about OOP from public service exams (to work with IT).
